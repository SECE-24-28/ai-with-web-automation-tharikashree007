# Resume RAG System

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that allows users to ask questions about a resume PDF using semantic search and Google's Gemini Large Language Model. The system extracts resume content, stores embeddings in ChromaDB, retrieves relevant information, and generates accurate answers based solely on the resume content.

* Semantic embeddings using Sentence Transformers
* Vector storage with ChromaDB
* Similarity-based retrieval
* Gemini-powered answer generation
* Context-aware responses
* Reduced hallucinations through RAG
* CPU-only execution (GPU not required)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/resume-rag.git

cd resume-rag
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install pdfplumber chromadb sentence-transformers google-generativeai torch
```

Alternatively:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Configuration

### Configure Gemini API Key

Locate:

```python
genai.configure(api_key="")
```

Replace with:

```python
genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY")
```

### Add Resume PDF

Place your resume PDF inside the project folder.

Example:

```python
pdf_path = "resume.pdf"
```

---

## Running the Application

Run the following command:

```bash
python rag.py
```

Expected startup output:

```text
Extracting text from resume...
Chunking text into smaller segments...
Generating embeddings and storing in ChromaDB...

RAG System Ready!
Type 'exit' to stop.
```

## Example Queries

```text
What skills does the candidate have?

What projects has the candidate completed?

What programming languages are mentioned?

What certifications are listed?

What is the candidate's educational background?
```

---

## Sample Response

### Query

```text
What skills does the candidate have?
```

### Response

```text
The candidate has experience in:

- Python
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Natural Language Processing
```

If the information does not exist in the resume:

```text
Not mentioned in the resume.
```

## How It Works

### Step 1: Resume Parsing

The PDF resume is processed using pdfplumber to extract text content.

### Step 2: Text Chunking

The extracted text is divided into overlapping chunks to preserve context.

### Step 3: Embedding Generation

Sentence Transformers convert each chunk into vector embeddings.

### Step 4: Vector Storage

Embeddings are stored inside ChromaDB for efficient retrieval.

### Step 5: Query Processing

User questions are converted into embeddings and matched against stored vectors.

### Step 6: Context Retrieval

The most relevant chunks are retrieved based on semantic similarity.

### Step 7: Answer Generation

Retrieved context is passed to Gemini, which generates answers strictly from resume content.
